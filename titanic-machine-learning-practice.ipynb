The predictions are based on data categories such as class, sex, and ticket fare, which are suspected to have played decisive roles in the survival of passengers. Although age can be a great factor to look into, there is not enough data to train the predicting model.\nA Random Forest Classifier model has been used to simplify the predicting process, and the results take the form of 1 if the passenger survived or 0 if he/she didn't.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries
